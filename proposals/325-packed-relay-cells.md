# Introduction

In proposal 319 I suggested a way to fragment long commands across
multiple RELAY cells.  In this proposal, I suggest a new format for
RELAY cells that can be used to pack multiple relay commands into a
single cell.

Why would we want to do this?  As we move towards improved
congestion-control and flow-control algorithms, we might not want to
use an entire 498-byte relay payload just to send a one-byte
flow-control message.

We already have some cases where we'd benefit from this feature.
For example, when we send `SENDME` messages, `END` cells, or `BEGIN_DIR`
cells, most of the cell body is wasted with padding.

As a side benefit, packing cells in this way may make the job of the
traffic analyst a little more tricky, as cell contents become less
predictable.

# The basic design

Let's use the term "Relay Message" to mean the kind of thing that a
relay cell used to hold.  Thus, this proposal is about packing
multiple "Relay Messages" in to a cell.

I'll use "Packed relay cell" to mean a relay cell in this new
format, that supports multiple messages.

I'll use "client" to mean the initiator of a circuit, and "relay" to
refer to the parties through who a circuit is created.  Note that
each "relay" (as used here) may be the "client" on circuits of its own.

When a relay supports relay message packing, it advertises the fact using a
new Relay protocol version.  Clients must opt-in to using this protocol
version (see "Negotiation and Migration" section below ) before they can send
any packed relay cells, and before the relay will send them any packed relay
cells.

When packed cells are in use, multiple cell messages can be
concatenated in a single relay cell.

## Packed Cell Format

In order to have multiple commands within one single relay cell, they are
concatenated one after another following this format of a relay cell. The
first command is the same header format as a normal relay cell detailed in
section 6.1 of tor-spec.txt

  Relay Command   [1 byte]
  'Recognized'    [2 bytes]
  StreamID        [2 bytes]
  Digest          [4 bytes]
  Length          [2 bytes]
  Data            [Length bytes]
  RELAY\_MESSAGE
  Padding         [up to end of cell]

The `RELAY_MESSAGE` can be empty as in no bytes indicating no other messages
or set to the following:

   Relay Command   [1 byte]
   StreamID        [2 bytes]
   Length          [2 bytes]
   Data            [Length bytes]
   RELAY\_MESSAGE

Note that the Recognized and Digest field are not added to a second relay
message, they are solely used for the whole relay cell thus how we
encrypt/decrypt and recognize a cell is not changed, only the payload changes
to contain multiple messages.

The "Relay Command" byte "0" is now used to explicitly indicate "end of
commands".  If the byte "0" appears after a `RELAY_MESSAGE`, the rest of the
cell MUST be ignored.  (Note that this "end of commands" indicator may be
absent if there are no bytes remaining after the last message in the cell.)

Only some "Relay Command" are supported for relay cell packing:
  - `BEGIN_DIR`
  - `BEGIN`
  - `CONNECTED`
  - `DATA`
  - `DROP`
  - `END`
  - `PADDING_NEGOTIATED`
  - `PADDING_NEGOTIATE`
  - `SENDME`

If any relay message with a relay command _not_ listed above appears
in a packed relay cell with another relay message, then the
receiving party MUST tear down the circuit.

(Note that relay cell fragments (proposal 319) are not supported for
packing.)

When generating RELAY cells, implementations SHOULD (as they do today) fill in
the Padding field with four 0-valued bytes, followed by a sequence of random
bytes up to the end of the cell. If there are fewer than 4 unused bytes at the
end of the cell, those unused bytes should all be filled with 0-valued bytes.

# Negotiation and migration

After receiving a packed relay cell, the relay knows that the client
supports this proposal: Relays SHOULD send packed relay
cells on any circuit on which they have received a packed relay
cell.  Relays MUST NOT send packed relay cells otherwise.

Clients, in turn, MAY send packed relay cells to any relay whose
"Relay" subprotocol version indicates that it supports this
protocol.  To avoid fingerprinting, this client behavior should
controlled with a tristate (1/0/auto) torrc configuration value,
with the default set to use a consensus parameter.

The parameter is:

    "relay-cell-packing"

    Boolean: if 1, clients should send packed relay cells.
    (Min: 0, Max 1, Default: 0)

To handle migration, first the parameter should be set to 0 and the
configuration setting should be "auto".  To test the feature, individual
clients can set the tristate to "1".

Once enough clients have support for the parameter, the parameter
can be set to 1.


# A new relay message format

(This section is optional and should be considered separately; we
may decide it is too complex.)

Currently, every relay message uses 5 bytes of header to hold a
relay command, a length field, and a stream ID.  This is wasteful:
the stream ID is often redundant, and the top 7 bits of the length
field are always zero.

I propose a new relay message format, described here (with `ux`
denoting an x-bit bitfield).  This format is 2 bytes or 4 bytes,
depending on its first bit.

    struct relay_header {
       u1 stream_id_included; // Is the stream_id included?
       u6 relay_command; // as before
       u9 relay_data_len; // as before
       u8 optional_stream_id[]; // 0 bytes or two bytes.
    }

Alternatively, you can view the first three fields as a 16-bit
value, computed as:

    (stream_id_included<<15) | (relay_command << 9) | (relay_data_len).

If the `optional_stream_id` field is not present, then the default
value for the `stream_id` is computed as follows.  We use stream_id 0
for any command that doesn't take a stream ID.  For commands that
_do_ take a `steam_id`, we use whichever nonzero `stream_id` appeared
most recently in the same cell.

This format limits the space of possible relay commands.  That's
probably okay: after 20 years of Tor development, we have defined 25
relay command values.  But in case 2^6==64 commands will not be
enough, we reserve command values 48 through 63 for future formats
that need more command bits.
